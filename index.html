        <h2>Ex: LENOIR’S ‘PERPETUAL
            QUESO’ DRAWS CONTROVERSY AND INTRIGUE</h2>
        <p>Ex: An unusual but alluring odor has
            been wafting through Lenoir dining
            hall since the addition of the newfangled ‘Fabulous Fromage’ station. The
            dairy dedicated depot has replaced
            the contentious Ice Scream Stand, after complaints of hearing damage
            from students with a sweet tooth that
            neglected to carefully read the sign.
            The smell can be attributed to the
            latest gourmand that has taken up residence in the historic second floor university cafeteria. Hailing from the far out
            lands of Faroutland, Chef Silas Stroganoff has brought with him his pot of perpetual queso, a fondue that he claims has
            been brewing through six generations.
            The cheese is cautiously monitored by Chef Silas, who we found
            staring into the queso as it reflected
            his gaze like a well polished mirror.
            “O’er the years many people have
            come to taste my family’s queso, and
            countless cheeses have been added.”
            says Chef Stroganoff as he stands watch
            over the cauldron. From Gruyere to
            Camembert, each addition brings a
            taste and scent unique to their terroir.
            As Silas puts it, “each bite tells a story.”
            That story, however, may be one of
            health concerns. Camp Health, a small
            outcropping of tents manned by medical students, have voiced their worries
            about the cheesy concoction as they handle an overwhelming outbreak of Whey
            Warts that has spread throughout the
            student body since the appearance of
            Stroganoff’s pot of fermenting fromage.
            Despite medical maladies, fans of
            the perpetual queso continue to queue
            up for another helping of cheese, eagerly watching as Silas chucks another
            befuddling formaggio into the stewpot.</p>

        <h2> EX: OPINION: EDITIONS
            ARE NOT A GOOD EDI- TION AND ISSUES
            ARE AN ISSUE</h2>
            <p> EX: Have you ever read a themed Issue or Edition of a newspaper? The
                Answer is yes, you have. Even if you
                can’t read, you have still seen one!
                When a newspaper decides to release
                a themed Issue or Edition, an angel loses
                its wings, and a guy named Bythe tells
                a woman to smile more. There was a
                time before everything got all screwed
                up in which people wrote for freedom
                and not to be chained up by some theme
                like, “This issue is going to be the food
                issue,” or “This is the Abibliophobia
                Edition,” like what food related story
                can I even write about! Maybe I want
                to interview a guy about bananas without it being forced on me by the gods.
                Maybe I want to talk about the upand-coming sport Squigglepharmicide
                without my god given right of Freedom
                of writing stuff down getting revoked.
                And they’re on my tail. I swear. I am
                speaking the truth, and everyone else is
                against me! HELP! Especially that one
                cartoonist. I know they have hired him
                to kill me. Because I speak the truth.
                Anyways, for eons and years, there
                has been another type of newspaper
                that has stuck to just having random
                stories that don’t go together in any way
                unless by pure coincidence. That’s how
                newspapers should stay if we want our
                freedom to remain intact. CONT. Pg 5</p>
