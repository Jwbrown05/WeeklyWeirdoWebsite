        <h2>BIRDER MOST FOWL:
            BIRDWORLD AND
            THE INVENTION OF
            MURDER</h2>
        <p>One quarter of a fortnight ago, Professor Lewton Nord of the Terkyland Institute gave a guest lecture on the role of
            Bird World in the invention of murder.
            The talk was hosted by the University’s
            Intramural Rare Bird Killing Team at
            Abrahamson Hall. Many were in attendance though few wished to be there.
            Scholars have long squabbled over
            who exactly invented murder, though
            most of the prominent theories involve
            Bird World in some capacity. While theologians have suggested Cain’s killing of
            his brother Abel, likely at the behest of
            some bird, as the first murder, Lewton
            Nord has disproven this. Ancient texts
            uncovered by Nord in the Turkey Library at Terkyland Institute suggest that
            the story of Cain and Abel was a corruption of a much older historical anecdote
            from Bird World. The texts referred to
            “Crane” and “Abel Bird” as leaders of
            two warring factions. Previous methods
            of conflict resolution, including spitting,
            clawing, and squawking, had failed. Enraged at the continued existence of his
            rival, Crane discovered that if he clawed
            at Abel Bird until he stopped moving,
            Abel Bird would no longer be alive. Thus,
            the convenient catch-all and scratchall solution of murder was invented.
            Nord suggested that further research must be done into determining
            the veracity of the story of Crane and
            Abel Bird, though most scholars have
            thus far agreed that the tale was based
            on a real incident that took place in
            Bird World long before human history. </p>

        <h2>THE CRIME OF OUR
            TIMES: WHO KILLED
            PHILIPPE FLOP?</h2>
        <p>Beloved cartoonist Philippe Flop, creator of Buck and Sid, was found dead in
            his office cubicle Friday morning. He was
            a Frenchman, but we loved him anyway.
            Police surveyed the scene and ruled
            the cause of his passing to be Death
            by way of Murder. The cause of murder? It was the work of some unknown
            venomous poison toxin, likely administered the previous day around lunch
            hour. Flop’s body was discovered when
            its Errant Aroma notified our janitor
            and chief editor John Weirdsworth that
            something was amiss. A Miss Flop, Phillippe’s sister, was called and notified of
            her brother’s untimely termination from
            our staff and from the world of the living.
            Who killed Philippe Flop? That’s
            the million-dollar question gnawing
            at the heels of local investigators, who
            are offering a $10 reward for any information that leads to the killer’s capture. Police Bloo Bloo has warned the
            public; “There is a killer on the loose,
            slithering among us like some wicked
            beast. Be wary of what you eat or drink,
            for even now, their hands may be hasting to foul some other unsuspecting
            meal with the stuff death is made of.”
            Flop was last seen alive by Weekly Weirdo intern Sonart, who claims
            some sort of “robart” was seen with the
            Frenchman, although other staff members have suggested this “robart” may
            have just been a fork. As of now, we
            are not at liberty to discuss the suspects.
            However, many on staff suspect Fnord
            the Deceiver, one of our reporters, has
            something to hide. Others have pointed
            their fingers at Coach Thaddeus Bowlcut, who has been responsible for multiple deaths on the field of newspaper
            jousting. Even disgruntled former employee Habroham Blinken has caught
            the eye of the wary. However, Bloo Bloo
            ruled him out, deeming him a harmless fellow who whiles away his recently
            freed hours outside the Weekly Weirdo
            office in his car, loaded gun in hand.
            Philippe Flop is survived by his sister,
            some grifter, his old missus and mister
            and all his other relatives who are currently alive. In a rare statement, proprietor Wardlow Weirdsworth said, “Pillippe Flop–who is that, eh? Oh. Strange
            fellow. Never knew quite what to make
            of him meself.” His funny accent and
            strange mannerisms brought an unnecessary continental flair to the Weekly
            Weirdo office. His cartoons, however,
            were the stuff of legend, his greatest passion aside from drinking wine and feeling
            fine. We shall miss him, but not too much.

        <h2>LENOIR’S ‘PERPETUAL
            QUESO’ DRAWS CONTROVERSY AND INTRIGUE</h2>
        <p>An unusual but alluring odor has
            been wafting through Lenoir dining
            hall since the addition of the newfangled ‘Fabulous Fromage’ station. The
            dairy dedicated depot has replaced
            the contentious Ice Scream Stand, after complaints of hearing damage
            from students with a sweet tooth that
            neglected to carefully read the sign.
            The smell can be attributed to the
            latest gourmand that has taken up residence in the historic second floor university cafeteria. Hailing from the far out
            lands of Faroutland, Chef Silas Stroganoff has brought with him his pot of perpetual queso, a fondue that he claims has
            been brewing through six generations.
            The cheese is cautiously monitored by Chef Silas, who we found
            staring into the queso as it reflected
            his gaze like a well polished mirror.
            “O’er the years many people have
            come to taste my family’s queso, and
            countless cheeses have been added.”
            says Chef Stroganoff as he stands watch
            over the cauldron. From Gruyere to
            Camembert, each addition brings a
            taste and scent unique to their terroir.
            As Silas puts it, “each bite tells a story.”
            That story, however, may be one of
            health concerns. Camp Health, a small
            outcropping of tents manned by medical students, have voiced their worries
            about the cheesy concoction as they handle an overwhelming outbreak of Whey
            Warts that has spread throughout the
            student body since the appearance of
            Stroganoff’s pot of fermenting fromage.
            Despite medical maladies, fans of
            the perpetual queso continue to queue
            up for another helping of cheese, eagerly watching as Silas chucks another
            befuddling formaggio into the stewpot.</p>

        <h2> OPINION: EDITIONS
            ARE NOT A GOOD EDI- TION AND ISSUES
            ARE AN ISSUE</h2>
            <p> Have you ever read a themed Issue or Edition of a newspaper? The
                Answer is yes, you have. Even if you
                can’t read, you have still seen one!
                When a newspaper decides to release
                a themed Issue or Edition, an angel loses
                its wings, and a guy named Bythe tells
                a woman to smile more. There was a
                time before everything got all screwed
                up in which people wrote for freedom
                and not to be chained up by some theme
                like, “This issue is going to be the food
                issue,” or “This is the Abibliophobia
                Edition,” like what food related story
                can I even write about! Maybe I want
                to interview a guy about bananas without it being forced on me by the gods.
                Maybe I want to talk about the upand-coming sport Squigglepharmicide
                without my god given right of Freedom
                of writing stuff down getting revoked.
                And they’re on my tail. I swear. I am
                speaking the truth, and everyone else is
                against me! HELP! Especially that one
                cartoonist. I know they have hired him
                to kill me. Because I speak the truth.
                Anyways, for eons and years, there
                has been another type of newspaper
                that has stuck to just having random
                stories that don’t go together in any way
                unless by pure coincidence. That’s how
                newspapers should stay if we want our
                freedom to remain intact. CONT. Pg 5</p>
