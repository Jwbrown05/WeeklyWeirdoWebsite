        <h2>Birder Most Fowl: 
            Bird World and the Invention of Murder</h2>
        <p> One quarter of a fortnight ago, Professor Lewton Nord of the Terkyland Institute gave a guest lecture on the role of Bird World in the invention of murder. The talk was hosted by the University’s Intramural Rare Bird Killing Team at Abrahamson Hall. Many were in attendance though few wished to be there.
            Scholars have long squabbled over who exactly invented murder, though most of the prominent theories involve Bird World in some capacity. While theologians have suggested Cain’s killing of his brother Abel, likely at the behest of some bird, as the first murder, Lewton Nord has disproven this. 
            Ancient texts uncovered by Nord in the Turkey Library at Terkyland Institute suggest that the story of Cain and Abel was a corruption of a much older historical anecdote from Bird World. The texts referred to “Crane” and “Abel Bird” as leaders of two warring factions. Previous methods of conflict resolution, including spitting, clawing, and squawking, had failed. Enraged at the continued existence of his rival, Crane discovered that if he clawed at Abel Bird until he stopped moving, Abel Bird would no longer be alive. Thus, the convenient catch-all and scratch-all solution of murder was invented.
            Nord suggested that further research must be done into determining the veracity of the story of Crane and Abel Bird, though most scholars have thus far agreed that the tale was based on a real incident that took place in Bird World long before human history.

        <h2>COWBOY HEADS
            WEST, ENDS UP IN
            THE EAST</h2>
        <p> “I followed the sun, but she done looped me ‘round like a sarsaparilla drunk on a carousel,” he sobbed.
            APRIL 21 — Residents awoke Tuesday to find a dust-coated stranger muttering incoherently and licking a compass as if it might yield better directions with some seduction.
            “I reckon I took a left at the tumbleweeds when I should have ignored it completely,” stated Bucklaroo McTeeth, a geographically challenged frontier enthusiast. “Now I find myself in a town where the sun rises behind me instead of in front. This ain’t west. This is the… east... deep east.” “He rolled in hollerin’ about gold rushes and cattle rustlin’. We ain't got either,” sniffed Willy Williams, town librarian and unofficial judge of spatial violations. 
            Sheriff Petey Criminal confronted McTeeth at high noon. “This ain’t no west, partner. You’re pollutin’ our town,” he declared. Locals claimed to see the Sheriff reach for his holster to pull out his map.
            In a subsequent interview, McTeeth seemed perplexed but unrepentant. “Wherever I go, that’s the West,” he opined, chewing on a straw that may have been a pipe cleaner. “I may be lost, but I’m authentically lost. Which is the cowboy way.”
            The town is currently undergoing spiritual fumigation and has petitioned to be relocated even further east to prevent recurrence.
            Bucklin, meanwhile, has been escorted to the nearest philosophical crossroad and spun three times counterclockwise “to reset his bearings.” He was last seen riding a goat named Harold toward what may or may not be destiny.

        <h2>Ex: LENOIR’S ‘PERPETUAL
            QUESO’ DRAWS CONTROVERSY AND INTRIGUE</h2>
        <p>Ex: An unusual but alluring odor has
            been wafting through Lenoir dining
            hall since the addition of the newfangled ‘Fabulous Fromage’ station. The
            dairy dedicated depot has replaced
            the contentious Ice Scream Stand, after complaints of hearing damage
            from students with a sweet tooth that
            neglected to carefully read the sign.
            The smell can be attributed to the
            latest gourmand that has taken up residence in the historic second floor university cafeteria. Hailing from the far out
            lands of Faroutland, Chef Silas Stroganoff has brought with him his pot of perpetual queso, a fondue that he claims has
            been brewing through six generations.
            The cheese is cautiously monitored by Chef Silas, who we found
            staring into the queso as it reflected
            his gaze like a well polished mirror.
            “O’er the years many people have
            come to taste my family’s queso, and
            countless cheeses have been added.”
            says Chef Stroganoff as he stands watch
            over the cauldron. From Gruyere to
            Camembert, each addition brings a
            taste and scent unique to their terroir.
            As Silas puts it, “each bite tells a story.”
            That story, however, may be one of
            health concerns. Camp Health, a small
            outcropping of tents manned by medical students, have voiced their worries
            about the cheesy concoction as they handle an overwhelming outbreak of Whey
            Warts that has spread throughout the
            student body since the appearance of
            Stroganoff’s pot of fermenting fromage.
            Despite medical maladies, fans of
            the perpetual queso continue to queue
            up for another helping of cheese, eagerly watching as Silas chucks another
            befuddling formaggio into the stewpot.</p>

        <h2> EX: OPINION: EDITIONS
            ARE NOT A GOOD EDI- TION AND ISSUES
            ARE AN ISSUE</h2>
            <p> EX: Have you ever read a themed Issue or Edition of a newspaper? The
                Answer is yes, you have. Even if you
                can’t read, you have still seen one!
                When a newspaper decides to release
                a themed Issue or Edition, an angel loses
                its wings, and a guy named Bythe tells
                a woman to smile more. There was a
                time before everything got all screwed
                up in which people wrote for freedom
                and not to be chained up by some theme
                like, “This issue is going to be the food
                issue,” or “This is the Abibliophobia
                Edition,” like what food related story
                can I even write about! Maybe I want
                to interview a guy about bananas without it being forced on me by the gods.
                Maybe I want to talk about the upand-coming sport Squigglepharmicide
                without my god given right of Freedom
                of writing stuff down getting revoked.
                And they’re on my tail. I swear. I am
                speaking the truth, and everyone else is
                against me! HELP! Especially that one
                cartoonist. I know they have hired him
                to kill me. Because I speak the truth.
                Anyways, for eons and years, there
                has been another type of newspaper
                that has stuck to just having random
                stories that don’t go together in any way
                unless by pure coincidence. That’s how
                newspapers should stay if we want our
                freedom to remain intact. CONT. Pg 5</p>
