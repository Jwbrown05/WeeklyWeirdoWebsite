<h2> This is the Weekly Weirdo Website</h2>
<p> Its a website dedecated to the readers of UNC's Satire Newspaper's the Weekly Weirdo</p>
<p> At the top of the website I have a navigation part that eventually <br> will go to different pages (other .html files I have not made yet)</p>
<p> It'll serve almost like the NYTimes website as a place for people to read articles <br> if they didn't get the edition in the pit</p>
