        <h2>THE HUMOR SECTION</h2>
        <p>Stand up, my friend, quick. I
            left a humor in your chair and
            you sat on it. Let’s see if it is not
            too squashed. What do you call
            a cross between a moose and
            bus my friends? Do you know?
            I do not think you do. The an-
            swer is a moose-bus, my friends.</p>

        <h2>REAL STORIES
            AND THINGS LIKE THAT</h2>
        <p> I remember at the end of sec-
            ond-grade we did the customary year-
            book signing. When I signatures from
            the Prune, Sara, Abigail and J-dawg, I
            circled them an made a “surrender box”
            around them. As I’ve written here before,
            Sports inflamed our leadership conflict
            by signing his name “President Sports.”
            The real mystery, however, came in Hen-
            ry’s journal. A For some completely un-
            known reason, our acquaintance Jake and
            our archnemisis, the Prune, both wrote,
            “Turn the Lights On.” We never could
            remember or figure out what it meant.

        <h2>TIE FIGHTER TO FIGHT
            DETERMINATOR
            MATCH OF THE CENTURY</h2>
        <p>Bradford in the Thanksgiving Rum-
            ble has there been such an anticipated
            bout in the world of boxing. Hometown
            hero the Tie Fighter will finally face off
            against hometown zero the Determi-
            nator, both of whom come from some
            town. The two who-doggers grew up in
            the same rough and tumble neighbor-
            hood of high class West Frank Street.
            The Tie Fighter was always first in
            line at the local tie store. With a record
            of 20 knockouts and 18 fatalities, the Tie
            Fighter has never been afraid of finish-
            ing a fight with one quick slash of the
            knife he conceals in the folds of his tie.
            Though the Determinator’s record
            remains at a disappointing 3 knockouts
            and 7 fatalities, his record of predict-
            ing the outcome of matches is unde-
            feated. Any time he determined that he
            would lose a match, he used his quick
            wits to forfeit. If throwing in the towel
            is not an option, the Determinator de-
            termines his opponent’s destiny with
            the shotgun he conceals in his shoe.
            In the highly regulated sport of gen-
            tleman boxing, only three hidden weap-
            ons are allowed per round. There has
            been much talk this season about the
            Tie Fighter potentially switching out his
            knife for a hand grenade if things get
            gribby. The Determinator is predict-
            ed to stick with his trusty shotgun if he
            does not forfeit first. He also has a mean
            right hook, taken from an industrial
            meat factory and sharpened to the quick.
            As a reminder, killing is not al-
            lowed in gentleman boxing.</p>
