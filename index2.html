        <h2>REAL STORIES
            AND THINGS LIKE THAT</h2>
        <p>OI remember at the end of second-grade we did the customary yearbook signing. When I signatures from
            the Prune, Sara, Abigail and J-dawg, I
            circled them an made a “surrender box”
            around them. As I’ve written here before,
            Sports inflamed our leadership conflict
            by signing his name “President Sports.”
            The real mystery, however, came in Henry’s journal. A For some completely unknown reason, our acquaintance Jake and
            our archnemisis, the Prune, both wrote,
            “Turn the Lights On.” We never could
            remember or figure out what it meant. </p>

        <h2>REVIEW: PRUNE, THE
            PRUNE STORY</h2>
        <p>Prune Films Studios Productions’
            newtest film, Prune: The Prune Story is
            about as worthless as a prune on a
            hot Summer’s day. The latest in a series of otherwise stellar films regarding the Esteyem tradition, Prune is one
            dried fruit better left out in the sun.
            The film, if you can call it that,
            stars Millie Vanderwoggin in the titular role. Her performance is the only
            tolerable element of the picture. With
            a passing resemblance to the villain in
            question and acting chops that are at
            least a quarter of halfway decent, she
            is believable as the Prune if one walks
            into the theatre absolutely stinko. The
            same cannot be said of the other actors.
            The plot is more of the same biopic
            claptrap garbage, some soppy story about
            the Prune being a decent person before
            she bathed too long in the tub of wickedness, leaving her quite prune-y. The
            greatest travesty is the minimal regard is
            paid to the heros, Bill and Henry. They
            get little screen time and their actors respective performances are second-rate,
            worthy of a dumpster fire in a tornado.
            Some may cry, “Is it so wrong to focus
            on the villain, on what made her as she
            is? Is it wrong to tell a story away from
            the heroes, to understand a world where
            they may not be the center of the story?” To that I must simply answer, “Yes.”</p>

        <h2>REAL DREAMS</h2>
        <p>Twas the night before a big exam
            The UNC stoods were getting ready for
            bed
            They all got in their average-sized bed
            together in their bedtime smocks
            They were sleeping head-to-head and
            toe to toe
            Curled up with one big blanket
            In the middle of the night, one of them
            got up, Shaun-stood, and drank a lot
            of water
            When one of the stoods awoke let’s call
            her Jude
            She found that the bed was wet
            Jude-stood chose to blame Aimes
            but she rejected that she wasn’t that
            lame
            Then Jude-stood chose to blame Shaun
            At that point, she was called out
            “Jude-stood you are rude and have the
            wrong tood”
            Jude was confused as she was sure she
            saw Shaun drink lots of water before
            sleeping, but now she was being
            treated as if she was the bad guy it
            did not make any sense to her
            -This is a real dream by an anonymous UNC student with the names
            in the dream changed to keep
            the identity of this person secret.</p>

        <h2> OPINION: EDITIONS
            ARE NOT A GOOD EDI- TION AND ISSUES
            ARE AN ISSUE</h2>
            <p> Have you ever read a themed Issue or Edition of a newspaper? The
                Answer is yes, you have. Even if you
                can’t read, you have still seen one!
                When a newspaper decides to release
                a themed Issue or Edition, an angel loses
                its wings, and a guy named Bythe tells
                a woman to smile more. There was a
                time before everything got all screwed
                up in which people wrote for freedom
                and not to be chained up by some theme
                like, “This issue is going to be the food
                issue,” or “This is the Abibliophobia
                Edition,” like what food related story
                can I even write about! Maybe I want
                to interview a guy about bananas without it being forced on me by the gods.
                Maybe I want to talk about the upand-coming sport Squigglepharmicide
                without my god given right of Freedom
                of writing stuff down getting revoked.
                And they’re on my tail. I swear. I am
                speaking the truth, and everyone else is
                against me! HELP! Especially that one
                cartoonist. I know they have hired him
                to kill me. Because I speak the truth.
                Anyways, for eons and years, there
                has been another type of newspaper
                that has stuck to just having random
                stories that don’t go together in any way
                unless by pure coincidence. That’s how
                newspapers should stay if we want our
                freedom to remain intact. CONT. Pg 5</p>

        <h2> DEAR TURKEY...</h2>
            <p> <b>Advice from Turkey, esteemed author, artist, musician, architect, chef, scientist
                and all-around great mind.</b>
                <br>
                
                My gecko won’t talk to me. How do I change this?
                Turkey (Response translated from Terkyspeek): Feed him.
                Does anyone know where the bathroom is??
                Turkey (Response translated from Terkyspeek): I have
                a bathroom but you cannot use it.
                How does one find housing in the great 2025?
                Turkey (Response translated
                from Terkyspeek): I have many
                houses, I do not need anymore.
                What recipe would you recommend to impress a hot date?
                Turkey (Response translated
                from Terkyspeek): Corn potato pie.
                What are your opinions on Thanksgiving?
                Turkey (Response translated from
                Terkyspeek): Thanksgiving? Never
                have I heard of so disgusting a holiday
                as that which fools call “Thanksgiving.”
                What thanks have I when my brethren
                are slaughtered and eaten by oafs and
                buffoons who are not match for my mind.
                They slobber over gravy and the flesh of
                innocent birds, pretending we have no
                rights, no feelings. You would not like it
                if I and my feathered friends celebrated a
                holiday by feasting on YOU!!!!!! If I had
                my will, every idiot who goes about with
                “Merry Thanksgiving” on his lips would
                be eaten by his own Turkey and buried
                with a cornucopia through his heart.
                I prefer Thanksgribbing. Good day.
                What is a good birthday present for
                a friend whose b-day is May 4th?
                Turkey (Response translated
                from Terkyspeek): You can purchase my complete works at any bookstore of worth. They are a trove of infinite knowledge. If not, a pocket copy
                of my most famous book, Me in Storybook, is carried by almost all retailers.
                I’ve been battling with IBS (Important and Beautiful Syndrome)
                and I need advice on staying humble
                Turkey (Response translated
                from Terkyspeek): Those who
                pray humble stay humble. Besides,
                you’ll never be as important and beautiful as me. Cry yourself to sleep</p>
